      "Context ==> ['<Document href=\"https://www.scalablepath.com/machine-learning/langgraph\"/>\\nIn fact, the rapid adoption of AI agents by companies indicates a strategic shift. Early movers are using AI agents to handle tasks that were once bottlenecks, gaining an edge in customer responsiveness, data analysis, and innovation capacity. Using a framework like LangGraph ensures these AI initiatives are scalable and maintainable, so one is building a long-term strategic asset, not just a demo or one-off script.\\n\\n### Practical Gains: Save Time and Money While Reducing Errors [...] Another advantage of the LangGraph approach is that one can precisely control when and how agents interact. The graphâs edges and nodes act like a playbook for the team of agents. One can have phases in the workflow where agents work in parallel, and then points where the workflow pauses and awaits a decision or input. [...] At scale, LangGraph doesnât just give you flexibility, it gives you reliability. In production environments, AI workflows often need features like caching results, retrying on failure, handling long-running tasks, and more â all of which LangGraph supports.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.zams.com/blog/crewai-vs-langgraph\"/>\\nOn the other hand, LangGraph built on LangChain provides more control. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a great choice for software development teams and engineering teams to develop complex workflows for specific use cases. LangGraph\\'s agent capabilities allow agents to manage tasks independently while a supervisor orchestrates their interactions, enhancing overall efficiency and scalability. [...] LangGraph is an open-source AI framework to develop, deploy and manage advanced workflows for generative AI agents. Using graph-based architecture LangGraph handles the relationships between different components of the AI workflow.Ã\\n\\nLangGraph applications offer robust features like scalable infrastructure and self-hosted deployment options that enhance workflow management and processing without adding overhead. [...] With LangGraph Studio, a visual interface to develop workflows, users can reduce coding. One of LangGraphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s key features is its state management system which acts like a memory bank, storing information and enabling better state management and debugging. Users can run LangGraph Platform entirely on their own infrastructure as part of a Self-Hosted Enterprise solution, allowing companies to maintain control over their data while outsourcing the management of some services.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.getzep.com/ai-agents/langchain-agents-langgraph/\"/>\\nLangGraph\\'s visual workflow design makes it easier to understand and manage complex task dependencies, enhancing maintainability. LangGraph provides more granular control over agent actions and interactions.\\n\\n### Scalability issues\\n\\nWhen LangChain starts to show limitations in handling large-scale or highly interactive workflows.\\n\\n### Integration requirements\\n\\nWhen integrating with other tools like LangSmith for monitoring and optimization becomes essential.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://medium.com/@vikaskumarsingh_60821/langgraph-the-future-of-production-grade-ai-agent-architectures-623d68dbbfb6\"/>\\nAfter trying nearly every major agent framework out there, LangGraph has quietly but confidently become my go-to. What sets it apart isnât flashy abstractions or plug-and-play hype, itâs the sheer control and predictability it offers. The graph-based architecture gives me superpowers: I can visualize, debug, and optimize agent flows with surgical precision. No more magic black boxes or unexpected behavior from chatty agents. It also scales gracefully from quick prototypes to production [...] The framework continues to evolve rapidly, with improved visualization tools, enhanced performance optimizations, and deeper integration with the broader LangChain ecosystem. For teams building mission-critical AI systems, LangGraph represents not just the best current option, but a fundamentally correct approach to the challenges of agent orchestration. [...] , most frameworks provide inadequate mechanisms for recovering state.\\n2.   Debugging nightmares: Tracing the flow of complex agent interactions becomes nearly impossible without formal state tracking.\\n3.   âWorks on my machineâ syndrome: Systems that perform beautifully in development often fall apart under real-world conditions.\\n4.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in applications throughout industry and academia. Within the field of Artificial Intelligence, there are multiple subfields. The subfield of Machine learning has been used for various scientific and commercial purposes including language translation, image recognition, decision-making, credit scoring, and e-commerce. In recent years, there have been massive advancements in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence, which uses generative models to produce text, images, videos or other forms of data. This article describes applications of AI in different sectors. \\n\\n\\n== Agriculture ==\\n\\nIn agriculture, AI has been proposed as a way for farmers to identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatments to increase yields, thereby improving efficiency. AI has been used to attempt to classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and optimize irrigation.\\n\\n\\n== Architecture and design ==\\nAI in architecture has created a way for architects to create things beyond human understanding. AI implementation of machine learning text-to-render technologies, like DALL-E and stable Diffusion, gives power to visualization complex.\\nAI allows designers to demonstrate their creativity and even invent new ideas while designing. In future, AI will not replace architects; instead, it will improve the speed of translating ideas sketching.\\n\\n\\n== Business ==\\n\\n\\n=== Content extraction ===\\nAn optical character reader is used in the extraction of data in business documents like invoices and receipts. It can also be used in business contract documents e.g. employment agreements to extract critical data like employment terms, delivery terms, termination clauses, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Computer science ==\\n\\n\\n=== Programming assistance ===\\n\\n\\n==== AI-powered code assisting tools ====\\nAI can be used for real-time code completion, chat, and automated test generation. These tools are typically integrated with editors and IDEs as plugins. They differ in functionality, quality, speed, and approach to privacy. Code suggestions could be incorrect, and should be carefully reviewed by software developers before accepted. GitHub Copilot is one example. It was developed by GitHub and OpenAI and is able to autocomplete code in multiple programming languages.\\n\\n\\n==== Neural network design ====\\nAI can be used to create other AIs. For example, around November 2017, Google\\'s AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and POCO F1. NASNet\\'s performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet.\\n\\n\\n==== Quantum computing ====\\n\\nMachine learning has been used for noise-cancelling in quantum technology, including quantum sensors. Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic, quantum memristive device for neuromorphic (quantum-)computers (NC)/artificial neural networks and NC-using quantum materials with some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications, and quantum machine learning is a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used for quantum simulators which may have the application of solving physics and chemistry problems as well as for quantum annealers for training of neural networks for AI applications. There may also be some usefulness in chemistry, e.g. for drug discovery, and in materials science, e.g. for materials optimization/discovery (with possible relevance to quantum materials manufacturing).\\n\\n\\n=== Historical contributions ===\\nAI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science.

Early movers are using AI agents to handle tasks that were once bottlenecks, gaining an edge in customer responsiveness, data analysis, and innovation capacity. Using a framework like LangGraph ensures these AI initiatives are scalable and maintainable, so one is building a long-term strategic asset, not just a demo or one-off script.\\n\\n### Practical Gains: Save Time and Money While Reducing Errors [...] Another advantage of the LangGraph approach is that one can precisely control when and how agents interact. The graphâs edges and nodes act like a playbook for the team of agents. One can have phases in the workflow where agents work in parallel, and then points where the workflow pauses and awaits a decision or input. [...] At scale, LangGraph doesnât just give you flexibility, it gives you reliability. In production environments, AI workflows often need features like caching results, retrying on failure, handling long-running tasks, and more â all of which LangGraph supports.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.zams.com/blog/crewai-vs-langgraph\"/>\\nOn the other hand, LangGraph built on LangChain provides more control. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a great choice for software development teams and engineering teams to develop complex workflows for specific use cases. LangGraph\\'s agent capabilities allow agents to manage tasks independently while a supervisor orchestrates their interactions, enhancing overall efficiency and scalability. [...] LangGraph is an open-source AI framework to develop, deploy and manage advanced workflows for generative AI agents. Using graph-based architecture LangGraph handles the relationships between different components of the AI workflow.Ã\\n\\nLangGraph applications offer robust features like scalable infrastructure and self-hosted deployment options that enhance workflow management and processing without adding overhead.

What sets it apart isnât flashy abstractions or plug-and-play hype, itâs the sheer control and predictability it offers. The graph-based architecture gives me superpowers: I can visualize, debug, and optimize agent flows with surgical precision. No more magic black boxes or unexpected behavior from chatty agents. It also scales gracefully from quick prototypes to production [...] The framework continues to evolve rapidly, with improved visualization tools, enhanced performance optimizations, and deeper integration with the broader LangChain ecosystem. For teams building mission-critical AI systems, LangGraph represents not just the best current option, but a fundamentally correct approach to the challenges of agent orchestration.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in applications throughout industry and academia. Within the field of Artificial Intelligence, there are multiple subfields. The subfield of Machine learning has been used for various scientific and commercial purposes including language translation, image recognition, decision-making, credit scoring, and e-commerce. In recent years, there have been massive advancements in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence, which uses generative models to produce text, images, videos or other forms of data. This article describes applications of AI in different sectors. \\n\\n\\n== Agriculture ==\\n\\nIn agriculture, AI has been proposed as a way for farmers to identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatments to increase yields, thereby improving efficiency. AI has been used to attempt to classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and optimize irrigation.\\n\\n\\n== Architecture and design ==\\nAI in architecture has created a way for architects to create things beyond human understanding. AI implementation of machine learning text-to-render technologies, like DALL-E and stable Diffusion, gives power to visualization complex.\\nAI allows designers to demonstrate their creativity and even invent new ideas while designing. In future, AI will not replace architects; instead, it will improve the speed of translating ideas sketching.\\n\\n\\n== Business ==\\n\\n\\n=== Content extraction ===\\nAn optical character reader is used in the extraction of data in business documents like invoices and receipts. It can also be used in business contract documents e.g. employment agreements to extract critical data like employment terms, delivery terms, termination clauses, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Computer science ==\\n\\n\\n=== Programming assistance ===\\n\\n\\n==== AI-powered code assisting tools ====\\nAI can be used for real-time code completion, chat, and automated test generation. These tools are typically integrated with editors and IDEs as plugins. They differ in functionality, quality, speed, and approach to privacy. Code suggestions could be incorrect, and should be carefully reviewed by software developers before accepted. GitHub Copilot is one example. It was developed by GitHub and OpenAI and is able to autocomplete code in multiple programming languages.\\n\\n\\n==== Neural network design ====\\nAI can be used to create other AIs. For example, around November 2017, Google\\'s AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and POCO F1. NASNet\\'s performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet.\\n\\n\\n==== Quantum computing ====\\n\\nMachine learning has been used for noise-cancelling in quantum technology, including quantum sensors. Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic, quantum memristive device for neuromorphic (quantum-)computers (NC)/artificial neural networks and NC-using quantum materials with some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications, and quantum machine learning is a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used for quantum simulators which may have the application of solving physics and chemistry problems as well as for quantum annealers for training of neural networks for AI applications. There may also be some usefulness in chemistry, e.g. for drug discovery, and in materials science, e.g. for materials optimization/discovery (with possible relevance to quantum materials manufacturing).\\n\\n\\n=== Historical contributions ===\\nAI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science.

LangGraph Studioâs visualization and debugging tools enable efficient design and maintenance of complex agent interactions. This integration offers a powerful foundation for next-generation multi-agent systems, providing effective workflow handling, context maintenance, reliable results, and optimal resource utilization. [...] LangGraph Studio offers flexible configuration management through its intuitive interface. As shown in the following screenshot, you can create and manage multiple configuration versions (v1, v2, v3) for your graph execution. For example, in this scenario, we want to use `user_id` to fetch historic use information. This versioning system makes it simple to track and switch between different test configurations while debugging your multi-agent system. [...] This example demonstrates the supervisor agentic pattern, where a supervisor agent coordinates multiple specialized agents. Each agent maintains its own scratchpad while the supervisor orchestrates communication and delegates tasks based on agent capabilities. This distributed approach improves efficiency by allowing agents to focus on specific tasks while enabling parallel processing and system scalability.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://blog.langchain.com/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/\"/>\\nImage 5\\nYouTube Walkthrough\\n-------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve added a YouTube video to walk through these three examples.

For example, if you have two agents, `alice` and `bob` (subgraph nodes in a parent graph), and `alice` needs to navigate to `bob`, you can set `graph=Command.PARENT` in the `Command` object: [...] An agent might need to have a different state schema from the rest of the agents.

There are two ways to achieve this in LangGraph: [...] There are two high-level approaches to achieve that:\\n\\n1.   Store these messages in the shared message list, but filter the list before passing it to the subagent LLM. For example, you can choose to filter out all tool calls from other agents.\\n2.

The increasing adoption of AI agents signifies a strategic move by companies to automate tasks, enhance customer responsiveness, and improve data analysis [1]. LangGraph's graph-based architecture offers a structured approach to managing interactions between AI agents, providing greater control, predictability, and scalability compared to other frameworks [2]. This is crucial for enterprises aiming to build long-term strategic assets rather than short-lived demos [1].\\n\\nOne of the key advantages of LangGraph is its ability to manage the state of AI agents, addressing a common challenge in other frameworks where inadequate state recovery mechanisms can lead to debugging nightmares and scalability issues [2]. LangGraph's state management system acts as a memory bank, storing information and enabling better debugging [2]. The framework also supports features like caching results, retrying on failure, and handling long-running tasks, which are essential for production environments [1]. Furthermore, LangGraph Studio provides a visual interface for workflow development, reducing the need for extensive coding and simplifying the management of complex task dependencies [2, 3].\\n\\nLangGraph allows for precise control over agent interactions, enabling parallel processing and efficient resource utilization [1, 3]. The framework's flexibility extends to integration with other tools like LangSmith for monitoring and optimization [3]. Self-hosted deployment options further enhance workflow management and processing without adding overhead, allowing companies to maintain control over their data [2]. The ability to create and manage multiple configuration versions for graph execution simplifies debugging and testing [3].\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n[1] https://www.scalablepath.com/machine-learning/langgraph\\n[2] https://www.zams.com/blog/crewai-vs-langgraph\\n[3] https://www.getzep.com/ai-agents/langchain-agents-langgraph/\\n[4] https://medium.com/@vikaskumarsingh_60821/langgraph-the-future-of-production-grade-ai-agent-architectures-623d68dbbfb6\\n[5] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-multi-agent-systems-with-langgraph-and-amazon-bedrock/\"]}, next=(), config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '3', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1f075dfa-48ef-6bb6-8005-c2340e2ce2ce'}}, metadata={'source': 'loop', 'writes': {'conduct_interview': {'sections': [\"## LangGraph: Scaling AI Agents in the Enterprise\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nLangGraph, built on LangChain, is emerging as a robust framework for developing, deploying, and managing complex AI agent workflows, particularly in enterprise environments.

When implementing memory systems in LangGraph agents, developers should consider: Proper memory management transforms LangGraph agents from simple query-response systems into sophisticated conversational partners capable of maintaining context, learning from past interactions, and providing personalized responses based on historical data. Its graph-based architecture enables developers to create sophisticated, stateful agents capable of handling complex workflows with built-in support for persistence, cycling, and human oversight. The framework\\'s ability to handle sophisticated workflows, combined with its robust memory management capabilities and tool integration options, makes it an ideal choice for building production-ready AI agents.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://medium.com/@saeedhajebi/langgraph-is-not-a-true-agentic-framework-3f010c780857\"/>\\nWeâll explore why, despite its strengths in workflow management and state handling, LangGraph lacks the essential characteristics that define truly autonomous agentic systems, and how it compares technically to more fully agentic frameworks like AutoGPT, BabyAGI, and AutoGen. The official LangGraph documentation explicitly states that developers must âdefine the behavior of your agents using three key components: State, Nodes, and Edges.â This requirement fundamentally constrains the systemâs autonomy, as all possible paths must be anticipated and encoded at design time. LangGraph represents a powerful tool for orchestrating complex LLM workflows, but a technical analysis clearly demonstrates that it falls short of being a true agentic framework due to its reliance on predefined workflows, limited autonomous decision-making, and lack of native self-improvement capabilities.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://medium.com/data-science/from-basics-to-advanced-exploring-langgraph-e8c1cf4db787\"/>\\nAs we discussed above, the cornerstone of the agent in LangGraph is its state, which enables the sharing of information between different parts of our graph. Thereâs only one function left âthe function for the conditional edge that defines whether we need to execute the tool or provide the final result. messages = [SystemMessage(content=editor_agent_prompt.format(question = state[\\'question\\'], answer = state[\\'answer\\']))] messages = [SystemMessage(content=editor_agent_prompt.format(question = state[\\'question\\'], answer = state[\\'answer\\']))] Image 27: Building a Multi-Agent RAG System with LangGraph and Mistral LLM: A Step-by-Step Guide Image 31: Building Smarter Agents with LangGraph: Tools, Memory & Workflows Langgraph Visualization with get_graph -------------------------------------- ### LangGraph is a library created to make it easier to create stateful, multi-agent applications that make use of Large Language Modelsâ¦\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://kanerika.com/blogs/langchain-vs-langgraph/\"/>\\nLangChain Vs LangGraph: Which Is Better For AI Agent Workflows In 2025?

When implementing memory systems in LangGraph agents, developers should consider: Proper memory management transforms LangGraph agents from simple query-response systems into sophisticated conversational partners capable of maintaining context, learning from past interactions, and providing personalized responses based on historical data. Its graph-based architecture enables developers to create sophisticated, stateful agents capable of handling complex workflows with built-in support for persistence, cycling, and human oversight.

The official LangGraph documentation explicitly states that developers must âdefine the behavior of your agents using three key components: State, Nodes, and Edges.â This requirement fundamentally constrains the systemâs autonomy, as all possible paths must be anticipated and encoded at design time. LangGraph represents a powerful tool for orchestrating complex LLM workflows, but a technical analysis clearly demonstrates that it falls short of being a true agentic framework due to its reliance on predefined workflows, limited autonomous decision-making, and lack of native self-improvement capabilities.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://medium.com/data-science/from-basics-to-advanced-exploring-langgraph-e8c1cf4db787\"/>\\nAs we discussed above, the cornerstone of the agent in LangGraph is its state, which enables the sharing of information between different parts of our graph.

This unpredictability means that simply chaining LLM calls (LangChain) or giving an agent more autonomy (LangGraph) wonât guarantee reliable results (Is LangGraph Used In Production?). A common pitfall is to assume the AI will always follow instructions â in reality, careful prompt design and output validation are needed. For example, a LangChain-based Q&A system might start to [...] generation (pulling product data to answer questions) and LangGraphâs tool usage (e.g., an agent that can place an order or check inventory via API). Even heavy industries like logistics have case studies: C.H. Robinson (logistics giant) is transforming freight management with LangChain, likely chaining LLM calls for tracking shipments and answering operational queries (Customer Stories). These real-world cases underscore a pattern: LangChain is commonly the âengineâ for language understanding [...] coordinate tasks like code generation, running code, and explaining output with human-in-the-loop oversight, all integrated into their IDE (LangGraph) (LangGraph). These examples show how LangGraph shines in software automation scenarios, where a sequence of interdependent tasks must be carried out by an AI with meticulous tracking of state and errors.

When implementing memory systems in LangGraph agents, developers should consider: Proper memory management transforms LangGraph agents from simple query-response systems into sophisticated conversational partners capable of maintaining context, learning from past interactions, and providing personalized responses based on historical data. Its graph-based architecture enables developers to create sophisticated, stateful agents capable of handling complex workflows with built-in support for persistence, cycling, and human oversight.

This unpredictability means that simply chaining LLM calls (LangChain) or giving an agent more autonomy (LangGraph) wonât guarantee reliable results (Is LangGraph Used In Production?). A common pitfall is to assume the AI will always follow instructions â in reality, careful prompt design and output validation are needed. For example, a LangChain-based Q&A system might start to [...] generation (pulling product data to answer questions) and LangGraphâs tool usage (e.g., an agent that can place an order or check inventory via API). Even heavy industries like logistics have case studies: C.H.

These real-world cases underscore a pattern: LangChain is commonly the âengineâ for language understanding [...] coordinate tasks like code generation, running code, and explaining output with human-in-the-loop oversight, all integrated into their IDE (LangGraph) (LangGraph).

This includes the veneration of shen (\\'spirits\\') and ancestors, and worship devoted to deities and immortals, who can be deities of places or natural phenomena, of human behaviour, or progenitors of family lineages. Stories surrounding these gods form a loose canon of Chinese mythology. By the Song dynasty (960â1279), these practices had been blended with Buddhist, Confucian, and Taoist teachings to form the popular religious system which has lasted in many ways until the present day. The government of modern China generally tolerates popular religious organizations, but has suppressed or persecuted those that they fear would undermine social stability.\\nAfter the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, governments and modernizing elites condemned \\'feudal superstition\\' and opposed traditional religious practices which they believed conflicted with modern values. By the late 20th century, these attitudes began to change in both mainland China and Taiwan, and many scholars now view folk religion in a positive light. In China, the revival of traditional religion has benefited from official interest in preserving traditional culture, such as Mazuism and the Sanyi teaching in Fujian, Yellow Emperor worship, and other forms of local worship, such as that of the Dragon King, Pangu or Caishen.\\nFeng shui, acupuncture, and traditional Chinese medicine reflect this world view, since features of the landscape as well as organs of the body are in correlation with the five powers and yin and yang.\\n\\n\\n== Diversity ==\\nChinese religions have a variety of sources, local forms, founder backgrounds, and ritual and philosophical traditions. Despite this diversity, there is a common core that can be summarised as four theological, cosmological, and moral concepts: Tian, the transcendent source of moral meaning; qi, the breath or energy that animates the universe; ancestor veneration; and bao ying \\'moral reciprocity\\'. With these, there are two traditional concepts of fate and meaning: ming yun, the personal destiny or burgeoning; and yuanfen \\'fateful coincidence\\', good and bad chances and potential relationships.\\nYin and yang is the polarity that describes the order of the universe, held in balance by the interaction of principles of extension (ç¥; shÃ©n; \\'spirit\\') and returning (é¬¼; guÇ; \\'ghost\\'), with yang (\\'act\\') usually preferred over yin (\\'receptiveness\\') in common religion. The taijitu and bagua are common diagrams representing the forces of nature, and the power that deities like Zhong Kui wield. Ling is the medium of the two states and the inchoate order of creation.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\n\\nThe Chinese language historically has not had a concept or overarching term for \"religion\". In English, the terms \\'popular religion\\' or \\'folk religion\\' have long been used to mean local religious life. In Chinese academic literature and common usage \\'folk religion\\' (æ°éå®æ; mÃ­njiÄn zÅngjiÃ o) refers to specific organised folk religious sects.\\nContemporary academic study of traditional cults and the creation of a government agency that gave legal status to this religion have created proposals to formalise names and deal more clearly with folk religious sects and help conceptualise research and administration. Terms that have been proposed include \\'Chinese native religion\\' (æ°ä¿å®æ; mÃ­nsÃº zÅngjiÃ o), \\'Chinese ethnic religion\\' (æ°æå®æ; mÃ­nzÃº zÅngjiÃ o), or \\'Chinese religion\\' (ä¸­è¯æ; zhÅnghuÃ¡jiÃ o) viewed as comparable to the usage of the term \"Hinduism\" for Indian religion. In Malaysia, reports the scholar Tan Chee-Beng, Chinese do not have a definite term for their traditional religion, which is not surprising because \"the religion is diffused into various aspects of Chinese culture\". They refer to their religion as \\'Buddha worship\\' (æä½; bÃ ifÃ³) or \\'spirit worship\\' (æç¥; bÃ ishÃ©n), which prompted Alan J. A. Elliott to suggest the term ç¥æ (shÃ©njiÃ o; \\'shenism\\').

It was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle\\'s Pike Place Market initially as a coffee bean wholesaler. Starbucks was converted into a coffee shop serving espresso-based drinks under the ownership of Howard Schultz, who was chief executive officer from 1986 to 2000 and led the aggressive expansion of the franchise across the West Coast of the United States.\\nAs of November 2022, the company had 35,711 stores in 80 countries, 15,873 of which were located in the United States. Of Starbucks\\' U.S.-based stores, over 8,900 are company-operated, while the remainder are licensed. It is the world\\'s largest coffeehouse chain. The company is ranked 120th on the Fortune 500 and 303rd on the Forbes Global 2000, as of 2022.\\nThe rise of the second wave of coffee culture is generally attributed to Starbucks, which introduced a wider variety of coffee experiences. Starbucks serves hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, micro-ground instant coffee, espresso, caffe latte, full and loose-leaf teas, juices, Frappuccino beverages, pastries, and snacks. Some offerings are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Depending on the country, most locations provide free Wi-Fi Internet access. The company has been subject to multiple controversies related to its business practices. Conversely, its franchise has commanded substantial brand loyalty, market share, and company value.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 20th century ===\\n\\n\\n==== 1970s ====\\nStarbucks originally opened in Seattle, Washington, on March 30, 1971. By selling high-quality coffee beans and equipments related, Starbucks became a local coffee bean retailer for the first ten years in Seattle. It was founded by business partners Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl and Gordon Bowker who first met as students at the University of San Francisco. The trio were inspired to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment by coffee roasting entrepreneur Alfred Peet. Bowker recalls that a business partner of his, Terry Heckler, thought words beginning with the letters \"st\" were powerful, leading the founders to create a list of words beginning with \"st\", hoping to find a brand name. They chose \"Starbo\", a mining town in the Cascade Range and from there, the group remembered \"Starbuck\", the name of the chief mate in the book Moby-Dick. Bowker said, \"Moby-Dick didn\\'t have anything to do with Starbucks directly; it was only coincidental that the sound seemed to make sense.\"\\nThe first Starbucks store was located in Seattle, at 2000 Western Avenue, from 1971 to 1976. The cafÃ© was later moved to 1912 Pike Place. During this time, Starbucks stores sold just coffee beans and not drinks. In its first two years of operation, Starbucks purchased green coffee beans from Peet\\'s Coffee & Tea. In 1973, Alfred Peet stopped supplying Starbucks and helped train their new Roastmaster, Jim Reynolds.\\n\\n\\n==== 1980s ====\\nIn 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Jerry Baldwin, purchased Peet\\'s Coffee. By 1986, the company was operating six stores in Seattle and had begun to sell espresso coffee.\\nIn 1987, the original owners sold the Starbucks chain to their former director of marketing Howard Schultz, who rebranded his Il Giornale coffee outlets as Starbucks and began to expand the company. Also in 1987, Starbucks opened its first locations outside of Seattle, in Waterfront Station in Vancouver, British Columbia, and in Chicago, Illinois.\\nBy 1989, there were 46 Starbucks stores located across the Pacific Northwest and Midwest, and the company was roasting more than 2,000,000 pounds (907,185 kg) of coffee annually.\\n\\n\\n==== 1990s ====\\nIn June 1992, at the time of its initial public offering, Starbucks (ticker symbol: SBUX) had 140 outlets, with revenue of US$73.5 million, up from US$1.3 million in 1987. The company\\'s market value was US$271 million by this time. The \\n</Document>']\n"

This unpredictability means that simply chaining LLM calls (LangChain) or giving an agent more autonomy (LangGraph) wonât guarantee reliable results (Is LangGraph Used In Production?). A common pitfall is to assume the AI will always follow instructions â in reality, careful prompt design and output validation are needed. For example, a LangChain-based Q&A system might start to [...] generation (pulling product data to answer questions) and LangGraphâs tool usage (e.g., an agent that can place an order or check inventory via API). Even heavy industries like logistics have case studies: C.H.

LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion\" page=\"\"/>\\nChinese folk religion comprises a range of traditional religious practices of Han Chinese, including the Chinese diaspora. This includes the veneration of shen (\\'spirits\\') and ancestors, and worship devoted to deities and immortals, who can be deities of places or natural phenomena, of human behaviour, or progenitors of family lineages. Stories surrounding these gods form a loose canon of Chinese mythology. By the Song dynasty (960â1279), these practices had been blended with Buddhist, Confucian, and Taoist teachings to form the popular religious system which has lasted in many ways until the present day. The government of modern China generally tolerates popular religious organizations, but has suppressed or persecuted those that they fear would undermine social stability.\\nAfter the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, governments and modernizing elites condemned \\'feudal superstition\\' and opposed traditional religious practices which they believed conflicted with modern values. By the late 20th century, these attitudes began to change in both mainland China and Taiwan, and many scholars now view folk religion in a positive light. In China, the revival of traditional religion has benefited from official interest in preserving traditional culture, such as Mazuism and the Sanyi teaching in Fujian, Yellow Emperor worship, and other forms of local worship, such as that of the Dragon King, Pangu or Caishen.\\nFeng shui, acupuncture, and traditional Chinese medicine reflect this world view, since features of the landscape as well as organs of the body are in correlation with the five powers and yin and yang.\\n\\n\\n== Diversity ==\\nChinese religions have a variety of sources, local forms, founder backgrounds, and ritual and philosophical traditions. Despite this diversity, there is a common core that can be summarised as four theological, cosmological, and moral concepts: Tian, the transcendent source of moral meaning; qi, the breath or energy that animates the universe; ancestor veneration; and bao ying \\'moral reciprocity\\'. With these, there are two traditional concepts of fate and meaning: ming yun, the personal destiny or burgeoning; and yuanfen \\'fateful coincidence\\', good and bad chances and potential relationships.\\nYin and yang is the polarity that describes the order of the universe, held in balance by the interaction of principles of extension (ç¥; shÃ©n; \\'spirit\\') and returning (é¬¼; guÇ; \\'ghost\\'), with yang (\\'act\\') usually preferred over yin (\\'receptiveness\\') in common religion. The taijitu and bagua are common diagrams representing the forces of nature, and the power that deities like Zhong Kui wield. Ling is the medium of the two states and the inchoate order of creation.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\n\\nThe Chinese language historically has not had a concept or overarching term for \"religion\". In English, the terms \\'popular religion\\' or \\'folk religion\\' have long been used to mean local religious life. In Chinese academic literature and common usage \\'folk religion\\' (æ°éå®æ; mÃ­njiÄn zÅngjiÃ o) refers to specific organised folk religious sects.\\nContemporary academic study of traditional cults and the creation of a government agency that gave legal status to this religion have created proposals to formalise names and deal more clearly with folk religious sects and help conceptualise research and administration.

It was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle\\'s Pike Place Market initially as a coffee bean wholesaler. Starbucks was converted into a coffee shop serving espresso-based drinks under the ownership of Howard Schultz, who was chief executive officer from 1986 to 2000 and led the aggressive expansion of the franchise across the West Coast of the United States.\\nAs of November 2022, the company had 35,711 stores in 80 countries, 15,873 of which were located in the United States. Of Starbucks\\' U.S.-based stores, over 8,900 are company-operated, while the remainder are licensed. It is the world\\'s largest coffeehouse chain. The company is ranked 120th on the Fortune 500 and 303rd on the Forbes Global 2000, as of 2022.\\nThe rise of the second wave of coffee culture is generally attributed to Starbucks, which introduced a wider variety of coffee experiences. Starbucks serves hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, micro-ground instant coffee, espresso, caffe latte, full and loose-leaf teas, juices, Frappuccino beverages, pastries, and snacks. Some offerings are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Depending on the country, most locations provide free Wi-Fi Internet access. The company has been subject to multiple controversies related to its business practices. Conversely, its franchise has commanded substantial brand loyalty, market share, and company value.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 20th century ===\\n\\n\\n==== 1970s ====\\nStarbucks originally opened in Seattle, Washington, on March 30, 1971. By selling high-quality coffee beans and equipments related, Starbucks became a local coffee bean retailer for the first ten years in Seattle. It was founded by business partners Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl and Gordon Bowker who first met as students at the University of San Francisco. The trio were inspired to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment by coffee roasting entrepreneur Alfred Peet. Bowker recalls that a business partner of his, Terry Heckler, thought words beginning with the letters \"st\" were powerful, leading the founders to create a list of words beginning with \"st\", hoping to find a brand name. They chose \"Starbo\", a mining town in the Cascade Range and from there, the group remembered \"Starbuck\", the name of the chief mate in the book Moby-Dick. Bowker said, \"Moby-Dick didn\\'t have anything to do with Starbucks directly; it was only coincidental that the sound seemed to make sense.\"\\nThe first Starbucks store was located in Seattle, at 2000 Western Avenue, from 1971 to 1976. The cafÃ© was later moved to 1912 Pike Place. During this time, Starbucks stores sold just coffee beans and not drinks. In its first two years of operation, Starbucks purchased green coffee beans from Peet\\'s Coffee & Tea. In 1973, Alfred Peet stopped supplying Starbucks and helped train their new Roastmaster, Jim Reynolds.\\n\\n\\n==== 1980s ====\\nIn 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Jerry Baldwin, purchased Peet\\'s Coffee. By 1986, the company was operating six stores in Seattle and had begun to sell espresso coffee.\\nIn 1987, the original owners sold the Starbucks chain to their former director of marketing Howard Schultz, who rebranded his Il Giornale coffee outlets as Starbucks and began to expand the company. Also in 1987, Starbucks opened its first locations outside of Seattle, in Waterfront Station in Vancouver, British Columbia, and in Chicago, Illinois.\\nBy 1989, there were 46 Starbucks stores located across the Pacific Northwest and Midwest, and the company was roasting more than 2,000,000 pounds (907,185 kg) of coffee annually.\\n\\n\\n==== 1990s ====\\nIn June 1992, at the time of its initial public offering, Starbucks (ticker symbol: SBUX) had 140 outlets, with revenue of US$73.5 million, up from US$1.3 million in 1987. The company\\'s market value was US$271 million by this time.

This means an agent can loop, retry, and reflect on its actions, a critical capability for tackling complex problems. It can attempt a task, evaluate the outcome, and if itâs not satisfactory, loop back to try a different approach. This supports diverse control flows, including: [...] At its core, LangGraph is a controllable cognitive architecture for any task. It is a library built to help developers create agentic and multi-agent applications with LLMs, by modeling workflows as a graph. This graph-based approach allows for cyclical processes, giving developers explicit control over the flow of logic. This is a significant departure from the more linear, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) often found in other data orchestration frameworks. [...] LangGraph represents a significant step forward in the development of intelligent applications. By providing a flexible, stateful, and controllable framework, it empowers developers to move beyond simple LLM integrations and build truly sophisticated agents capable of handling complex, real-world tasks. From its graph-based architecture that enables cyclical workflows to its deep support for human-in-the-loop collaboration, LangGraph is a powerful tool for anyone serious about production-grade\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langgraph\"/>\\nEnhanced decision-making: By modeling complex relationships between nodes, LangGraph provides a framework for building more effective decision-making systems.\\n\\nIncreased flexibility: An open source nature and modular design for developers to integrate new components and adapt existing workflows.\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\" page=\"\"/>\\nIn computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.\\nIn functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.\\nFunctional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely functional programming, a subset of functional programming that treats all functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects. This is in contrast with impure procedures, common in imperative programming, which can have side effects (such as modifying the program\\'s state or taking input from a user). Proponents of purely functional programming claim that by restricting side effects, programs can have fewer bugs, be easier to debug and test, and be more suited to formal verification.\\nFunctional programming has its roots in academia, evolving from the lambda calculus, a formal system of computation based only on functions. Functional programming has historically been less popular than imperative programming, but many functional languages are seeing use today in industry and education, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Wolfram Language, Racket, Erlang, Elixir, OCaml, Haskell, and F#. Lean is a functional programming language commonly used for verifying mathematical theorems. Functional programming is also key to some languages that have found success in specific domains, like JavaScript in the Web, R in statistics, J, K and Q in financial analysis, and XQuery/XSLT for XML. Domain-specific declarative languages like SQL and Lex/Yacc use some elements of functional programming, such as not allowing mutable values. In addition, many other programming languages support programming in a functional style or have implemented features from functional programming, such as C++11, C#, Kotlin, Perl, PHP, Python, Go, Rust, Raku, Scala, and Java (since Java 8).\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe lambda calculus, developed in the 1930s by Alonzo Church, is a formal system of computation built from function application. In 1937 Alan Turing proved that the lambda calculus and Turing machines are equivalent models of computation, showing that the lambda calculus is Turing complete. Lambda calculus forms the basis of all functional programming languages. An equivalent theoretical formulation, combinatory logic, was developed by Moses SchÃ¶nfinkel and Haskell Curry in the 1920s and 1930s.\\nChurch later developed a weaker system, the simply typed lambda calculus, which extended the lambda calculus by assigning a data type to all terms. This forms the basis for statically typed functional programming.\\nThe first high-level functional programming language, Lisp, was developed in the late 1950s for the IBM 700/7000 series of scientific computers by John McCarthy while at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Lisp functions were defined using Church\\'s lambda notation, extended with a label construct to allow recursive functions. Lisp first introduced many paradigmatic features of functional programming, though early Lisps were multi-paradigm languages, and incorporated support for numerous programming styles as new paradigms evolved. Later dialects, such as Scheme and Clojure, and offshoots such as Dylan and Julia, sought to simplify and rationalise Lisp around a cleanly functional core, while Common\\n</Document>']\n"

This misunderstanding can lead to the following problems:\\n\\n*   **Unrealistic Expectations:** The enterprise might expect the system to adapt to unforeseen circumstances or make independent decisions, which LangGraph, by design, cannot do without predefined rules [2].\\n*   **Implementation Delays:** The project might face delays as developers struggle to make the system behave as expected, leading to the need for significant rework to define all possible paths and outcomes [2].\\n*   **Cost Overruns:** The need for extensive customization and debugging to compensate for the lack of autonomy can lead to increased development costs and longer timelines.\\n\\nTo correct the course, the following steps are typically taken:\\n\\n*   **Reframing Expectations:** The project team needs to be educated about LangGraph's limitations and strengths, emphasizing its role in orchestrating predefined workflows rather than autonomous decision-making [2].\\n*   **Detailed Workflow Design:** A thorough analysis of the required tasks and decision points is essential. This involves mapping out all possible scenarios and defining the state, nodes, and edges that govern the agent's behavior [2].\\n*   **Human-in-the-Loop Integration:** Incorporating human oversight at critical stages can help manage the system's limitations.

While LangGraph excels in providing control and predictability, it does so at the expense of true autonomy [5].\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these limitations, LangGraph offers several advantages. It supports node-level caching, reducing redundant computation and speeding up execution [7]. It also provides built-in persistence, allowing agents to resume from where they left off after failures [8]. These features make LangGraph a powerful tool for building production-ready AI agents, particularly in scenarios requiring advanced flow control, persistent state, and human oversight [4, 6].\n",

Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history.\\nInitially available only in English, Wikipedia exists in over 340 languages and is the world\\'s ninth most visited website. The English Wikipedia, with over 7 million articles, remains the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 65 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per second on average)  as of April 2024. As of May 2025, over 25% of Wikipedia\\'s traffic comes from the United States, while Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia each account for around 5%.\\nWikipedia has been praised for enabling the democratization of knowledge, its extensive coverage, unique structure, and culture. Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site. Although Wikipedia\\'s volunteer editors have written extensively on a wide variety of topics, the encyclopedia has been criticized for systemic bias, such as a gender bias against women and a geographical bias against the Global South. While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward. Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for up-to-date information about those events.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Nupedia ===\\n\\nVarious collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success. Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman. Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal. On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.\\n\\n\\n=== Launch and rapid growth ===\\nWikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 (referred to as Wikipedia Day) as a single English language edition with the domain name www.wikipedia.com, and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia. Its integral policy of \"neutral point of view\" arose within its first year. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia. Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business.\\n\\nWikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004. Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former\\'s servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made in China during the Ming dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.\\nCiting fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wiki\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm\" page=\"\"/>\\nIn mathematics and computer science, an algorithm ( ) is a finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning).\\nIn contrast, a heuristic is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results. For example, although social media recommender systems are commonly called \"algorithms\", they actually rely on heuristics as there is no truly \"correct\" recommendation.\\nAs an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nAround 825 AD, Persian scientist and polymath Muá¸¥ammad ibn MÅ«sÄ al-KhwÄrizmÄ« wrote kitÄb al-á¸¥isÄb al-hindÄ« (\"Book of Indian computation\") and kitab al-jam\\' wa\\'l-tafriq al-á¸¥isÄb al-hindÄ« (\"Addition and subtraction in Indian arithmetic\"). In the early 12th century, Latin translations of these texts involving the HinduâArabic numeral system and arithmetic appeared, for example Liber Alghoarismi de practica arismetrice, attributed to John of Seville, and Liber Algorismi de numero Indorum, attributed to Adelard of Bath. Here, alghoarismi or algorismi is the Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi\\'s name; the text starts with the phrase Dixit Algorismi, or \"Thus spoke Al-Khwarizmi\".\\nThe word algorism in English came to mean the use of place-value notation in calculations; it occurs in the Ancrene Wisse from circa 1225. By the time Geoffrey Chaucer wrote The Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century, he used a variant of the same word in describing augrym stones, stones used for place-value calculation. In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word á¼ÏÎ¹Î¸Î¼ÏÏ (arithmos, \"number\"; cf. \"arithmetic\"), the Latin word was altered to algorithmus. By 1596, this form of the word was used in English, as algorithm, by Thomas Hood.\\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\n\\nOne informal definition is \"a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations\", which would include all computer programs (including programs that do not perform numeric calculations), and any prescribed bureaucratic procedure\\nor cook-book recipe. In general, a program is an algorithm only if it stops eventuallyâeven though infinite loops may sometimes prove desirable. Boolos, Jeffrey & 1974, 1999 define an algorithm to be an explicit set of instructions for determining an output, that can be followed by a computing machine or a human who could only carry out specific elementary operations on symbols.\\nMost algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain performing arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an electrical circuit, or a mechanical device.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Ancient algorithms ===\\nStep-by-step procedures for solving mathematical problems have been recorded since antiquity. This includes in Babylonian mathematics (around 2500 BC), Egyptian mathematics (around 1550 BC), Indian mathematics (around 800 BC and later), the Ifa Oracle (around 500 BC), Greek mathematics (around 240 BC), Chinese mathematics (around 200 BC and later), and Arabic mathematics (around 800 AD).\\nThe earliest evidence of\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://medium.com/@jalajagr/building-an-intelligent-research-assistant-a-deep-dive-into-langgraph-multi-agent-systems-b44c40bb2063\"/>\\nBuilding an Intelligent Research Assistant: A Deep Dive into LangGraph Multi-Agent Systems | by Jalaj Agrawal | Medium Image 16: LangGraphâs Multi-Agent Workflow Image 18: Building an AI Powered smart Travel Planner with Multi-Agent AI and LangGraph Image 20: AI Agents XII\\u200aâ\\u200aLangGraph graph-based framework\\xa0. ------------------------------------------------ ### LangGraph is a graph-based framework built on top of LangChain for orchestrating complex AI workflows and multi-agent systems.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson at the height of the Cold War. He remains the longest-serving secretary of defense, having remained in office over seven years. He played a major role in promoting the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. McNamara was responsible for the institution of systems analysis in public policy, which developed into the discipline known today as policy analysis.\\nMcNamara graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard Business School. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After World War II, Henry Ford II hired McNamara and a group of other Army Air Force veterans to work for the Ford Motor Company, reforming Ford with modern planning, organization, and management control systems. After briefly serving as Ford\\'s president, McNamara accepted an appointment as secretary of defense in the Kennedy administration.\\nMcNamara became a close adviser to Kennedy and advocated the use of a blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy and McNamara instituted a Cold War defense strategy of flexible response, which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. During the Kennedy administration, McNamara presided over a build-up of U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam escalated dramatically. McNamara and other U.S. policymakers feared that the fall of South Vietnam to a Communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region.\\nMcNamara grew increasingly skeptical of the efficacy of committing U.S. troops to South Vietnam. In 1968, he resigned as secretary of defense to become president of the World Bank. He served as its president until 1981, shifting the focus of the World Bank from infrastructure and industrialization towards poverty reduction. After retiring, he served as a trustee of several organizations, including the California Institute of Technology and the Brookings Institution. In later writings and interviews, including his memoir, McNamara expressed regret for some of the decisions he made during the Vietnam War.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and career ==\\nRobert McNamara was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Clara Nell McNamara (nÃ©e Strange) and Robert James McNamara.  His father was sales manager of a wholesale shoe company,  whose family was Irish and, in about 1850, following the Great Irish Famine, had emigrated to the U.S., first to Massachusetts and later to California.\\nMcNamara graduated from Piedmont High School in Piedmont, California in 1933, where he was president of the Rigma Lions boys club and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. According to McNamara, scouting helped him set his values and was where he first developed an interest in public service.\\nMcNamara attended the University of California, Berkeley and graduated in 1937 with a B.A. in economics with minors in mathematics and philosophy. He was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in his sophomore year, and earned a varsity letter in crew. McNamara was an ROTC Cadet in the Golden Bear Battalion at U.C. Berkeley. McNamara was also a member of the UC Berkeley\\'s Order of the Golden Bear, a fellowship of students and leading faculty members formed to promote leadership within the student body.\\nIn 1937, McNamara took a summer job as a sailor on the SS President Hoover. He was aboard when the Chinese Air Force bombed the ship near Shanghai Harbor. He was not injured.\\nMcNamara then attended Harvard Business School, where he earned a M.B.A. in 1939. Immediately thereafter, McNamara worked for a year at Price Waterhouse, a San Francisco accounting firm. He returned to Harvard in August 1940 to teach accounting in the Business School and bec\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.zenml.io/blog/langgraph-pricing\"/>\\nIn our research, we found that a user pointed out that the $0.001 per node fee effectively âdoubles my COGSâ for generating content, since each piece involved ~10 model calls (10 Ã $0.001 = $0.01 overhead) on top of the model API costs.\\n\\nThe Reddit user said, _âI just donât think the current pricing is reasonable for any system at scale,â_ suggesting it was about 10x higher than they anticipated.\\n\\nImage 16\\n\\nReddit userâs review on LangGraph [...] Even the Plus plan, if used sparingly, wonât break the bank.

However, maintenance costs can increase significantly as applications grow in complexity.\\n\\nLangGraph Economics Higher initial development investment due to architectural complexity, but lower long-term maintenance costs and better scalability characteristics.\\n\\n### Operational Costs [...] Resource Utilization LangGraphâs more efficient execution patterns can result in lower operational costs for complex applications, despite higher initial resource requirements.\\n\\nScaling Economics LangGraphâs architecture scales more efficiently, potentially providing better ROI for large-scale deployments.\\n\\nFuture Roadmap and Strategic Considerations\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n### Technology Evolution [...] LangChain Scaling Challenges As LangChain applications grow in complexity, they can become difficult to maintain and scale. The linear execution model doesnât naturally accommodate complex orchestration requirements.\\n\\nLangGraph Scaling Advantages LangGraphâs architecture is designed for scalability from the ground up. The graph-based approach naturally accommodates distributed execution and complex coordination patterns.\\n\\n### Integration and Migration\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.growthjockey.com/blogs/langgraph\"/>\\n### 3. Integration challenges with legacy systems\\n\\nCustom development is often needed to connect LangGraph with current enterprise systems, increasing complexity and maintenance demands.\\n\\nLegacy systems might lack the APIs or data formats required for smooth integration with graph-based AI. These challenges can cause deployment delays and higher total costs.\\n\\nSumming up on LangGraph\\n----------------------- [...] When handling graphs with thousands of nodes and complex links, LangGraphâs performance may drop significantly due to heavy computation for optimising traversal. Increased memory needs come with higher graph complexity, which might restrict deployment in resource-limited setups. Large-scale enterprise use may demand careful design and tuning of the framework.\\n\\n### 2. Complexity of graph modelling and design\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://ragaboutit.com/mastering-langgraph-a-production-ready-coding-walkthrough-for-software-engineers/\"/>\\nThe scalability of the LangGraph application was put to the test during the companyâs annual sale event, where customer inquiry volume increased by 300%. The Kubernetes-based deployment allowed for rapid scaling of resources, and the system maintained a 99.99% uptime throughout the event. [...] Scalability is a key concern for LangGraph applications in production. Implementing auto-scaling based on metrics like CPU utilization or request rate can ensure that the application can handle varying\\n\\nMonitoring and Maintaining LangGraph in Production\\n-------------------------------------------------- [...] Maintaining LangGraph applications in production involves regular updates, performance optimizations, and data management. Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of updates and new features. This pipeline should include automated testing to ensure that changes donât introduce regressions or negatively impact performance.\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_computing_and_communication\" page=\"\"/>\\nThis is a timeline of quantum computing and communication.\\n\\n\\n== 1960s ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1968/69/70 ===\\nStephen Wiesner invents conjugate coding.\\n\\n\\n=== 1969 ===\\n13 June â James L.

The talk was titled \"Quantum mechanical Hamiltonian models of discrete processes that erase their own histories: application to Turing machines\".

Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history.\\nInitially available only in English, Wikipedia exists in over 340 languages and is the world\\'s ninth most visited website. The English Wikipedia, with over 7 million articles, remains the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 65 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per second on average)  as of April 2024. As of May 2025, over 25% of Wikipedia\\'s traffic comes from the United States, while Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia each account for around 5%.\\nWikipedia has been praised for enabling the democratization of knowledge, its extensive coverage, unique structure, and culture. Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site. Although Wikipedia\\'s volunteer editors have written extensively on a wide variety of topics, the encyclopedia has been criticized for systemic bias, such as a gender bias against women and a geographical bias against the Global South. While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward. Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for up-to-date information about those events.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Nupedia ===\\n\\nVarious collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success. Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman. Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal. On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.\\n\\n\\n=== Launch and rapid growth ===\\nWikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 (referred to as Wikipedia Day) as a single English language edition with the domain name www.wikipedia.com, and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia. Its integral policy of \"neutral point of view\" arose within its first year. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia. Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business.\\n\\nWikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004. Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former\\'s servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made in China during the Ming dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.\\nCiting fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wiki\\n</Document>']\n"

LangGraph provides a framework for efficiently defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM agents (or chains) in a structured, cyclical manner.\\n\\nIn this article, we will explore how LangGraph helps to build robust, scalable and flexible multi-agent systems, making the development of intelligent AI workflows smoother and more efficient. [...] The diagram illustrates how LangGraph facilitates a dynamic, cyclic workflow for AI agents. The process begins with an initial state, which contains input data or context (in this case, a message from the customer asking about the advantages of solar panels). This state is passed to an agent node, which interacts with the customer to gather information, such as obtaining their electricity bill. After this interaction, the state is updated with the gathered information and passed to an edge, [...] LangGraph is an advanced library within the LangChain ecosystem addresses these limitations by introducing cyclic computational capabilities. While LangChain supports Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for linear workflows, LangGraph enables the creation of cycles, allowing LLM agents to dynamically loop through processes and make decisions based on evolving conditions. This framework empowers developers to build more complex, flexible, and adaptive agent systems.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n## Key Components\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.rapidinnovation.io/post/ai-agents-in-langgraph\"/>\\nAt Rapid Innovation, we understand that the integration of AI agents and LangGraph creates a powerful synergy that significantly enhances the capabilities of both technologies. AI agents are designed to perform tasks autonomously, while LangGraph provides a structured framework for natural language processing and understanding. This combination allows for more efficient and effective communication between AI systems and users, ultimately driving greater ROI for our clients. [...] LangGraph supports various types of AI agents, each designed for specific tasks and functionalities. Some common types include:\\n\\nBy leveraging the capabilities of LangGraph, Rapid Innovation can help clients develop tailored AI solutions that drive efficiency, enhance user engagement, and ultimately lead to greater ROI. Partnering with us means gaining access to cutting-edge technology and expert guidance, ensuring that your projects are executed effectively and efficiently. [...] Scaling AI agents in LangGraph is essential for enterprises looking to enhance their operational capabilities. At Rapid Innovation, we specialize in helping organizations expand the agent\\'s functionality and capacity to handle increased workloads effectively.\\n\\nBy leveraging our expertise, clients can achieve seamless scalability of their LangGraph agents, ensuring they are well-equipped to meet growing demands while maximizing their investment.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langgraph\"/>\\nAgent systems: LangGraph provides a framework for building agent-based systems, which can be used in applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles or video games.\\n\\nLLM applications: By using LangGraphâs capabilities, developers can build more sophisticated AI models that learn and improve over time. Norwegian Cruise Line uses LangGraph to compile, construct and refine guest-facing AI solutions. This capability allows for improved and personalized guest experiences. [...] LangGraph, created by LangChain, is an open source AI agent framework designed to build, deploy and manage complex generative AI agent workflows. It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable users to create, run and optimize large language models (LLMs) in a scalable and efficient manner. At its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an AI agent workflow. [...] By using a graph-based architecture, LangGraph enables users to scale artificial intelligence workflows without slowing down or sacrificing efficiency. LangGraph uses enhanced decision-making by modeling complex relationships between nodes, which means it uses AI agents to analyze their past actions and feedback. In the world of LLMs, this process is referred to as reflection.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.royalcyber.com/blogs/ai-ml/build-ai-agents-langgraph-langchain/\"/>\\nThis paper examines how LangGraph, built on top of LangChain, provides a structured framework for creating AI agents with enhanced reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and state management. By implementing directed cyclic graphs to control execution flow, these frameworks enable developers to build agents that can plan, execute, and reflect on their actionsâsignificantly improving task performance while maintaining transparency and control throughout the process. [...] This white paper explores the implementation of AI agents using LangGraph and LangChain, two powerful frameworks designed to orchestrate and enhance large language model (LLM) capabilities. It details the design and development of a multi-step decision-making agent architecture that can reason, plan, and solve complex problems through structured workflows. [...] Modular Design Enables Rapid Customization:The LangGraph architectureâs modular design enables quick agent capability extension and customization without necessitating a core system redesign.\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence\" page=\"\"/>\\nIn artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence (also known as classical artificial intelligence  or logic-based artificial intelligence)\\nis the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the mid-1990s. Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel\\'s Checkers Playing Program, led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the first AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969â1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988â2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition. Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning. Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant\\'s PAC learning, Quinlan\\'s ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.\\nNeural networks, a subsymbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and reemerged strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt\\'s perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams, and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989. However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: \"Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn\\'t work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.\" Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nA short history of symbolic AI to the present day follows below. Time periods and titles are drawn from Henry Kautz\\'s 2020 AAAI Robert S. Engelmore Memorial Lecture and the longer Wikipedia article on the History of AI, with dates and titles differing slightly for increased clarity.\\n\\n\\n=== The first AI summer: irrational e\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence\" page=\"\"/>\\nArtificial intelligence is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in applications throughout industry and academia. Within the field of Artificial Intelligence, there are multiple subfields. The subfield of Machine learning has been used for various scientific and commercial purposes including language translation, image recognition, decision-making, credit scoring, and e-commerce. In recent years, there have been massive advancements in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence, which uses generative models to produce text, images, videos or other forms of data. This article describes applications of AI in different sectors. \\n\\n\\n== Agriculture ==\\n\\nIn agriculture, AI has been proposed as a way for farmers to identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatments to increase yields, thereby improving efficiency. AI has been used to attempt to classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and optimize irrigation.\\n\\n\\n== Architecture and design ==\\nAI in architecture has created a way for architects to create things beyond human understanding. AI implementation of machine learning text-to-render technologies, like DALL-E and stable Diffusion, gives power to visualization complex.\\nAI allows designers to demonstrate their creativity and even invent new ideas while designing. In future, AI will not replace architects; instead, it will improve the speed of translating ideas sketching.\\n\\n\\n== Business ==\\n\\n\\n=== Content extraction ===\\nAn optical character reader is used in the extraction of data in business documents like invoices and receipts. It can also be used in business contract documents e.g. employment agreements to extract critical data like employment terms, delivery terms, termination clauses, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Computer science ==\\n\\n\\n=== Programming assistance ===\\n\\n\\n==== AI-powered code assisting tools ====\\nAI can be used for real-time code completion, chat, and automated test generation. These tools are typically integrated with editors and IDEs as plugins. They differ in functionality, quality, speed, and approach to privacy. Code suggestions could be incorrect, and should be carefully reviewed by software developers before accepted. GitHub Copilot is one example. It was developed by GitHub and OpenAI and is able to autocomplete code in multiple programming languages.\\n\\n\\n==== Neural network design ====\\nAI can be used to create other AIs. For example, around November 2017, Google\\'s AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and POCO F1. NASNet\\'s performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet.\\n\\n\\n==== Quantum computing ====\\n\\nMachine learning has been used for noise-cancelling in quantum technology, including quantum sensors. Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic, quantum memristive device for neuromorphic (quantum-)computers (NC)/artificial neural networks and NC-using quantum materials with some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications, and quantum machine learning is a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used for quantum simulators which may have the application of solving physics and chemistry problems as well as for quantum annealers for training of neural networks for AI applications. There may also be some usefulness in chemistry, e.g. for drug discovery, and in materials science, e.g. for materials optimization/discovery (with possible relevance to quantum materials manufacturing).\\n\\n\\n=== Historical contributions ===\\nAI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science.

As emphasized in the documentation: âCrucially, this is NOT a DAG frameworkâ¦ Cycles are important for agent-like behaviors, where you call an LLM in a loop, asking it what action to take next.â This capability enables the development of sophisticated agents that can iteratively refine their understanding and actions, leading to more capable AI [...] One of LangGraphâs core strengths is its automatic state management capability, which allows tracking and persistence of information across multiple interactions within an application. As agents perform tasks, the state is dynamically updated, ensuring the system maintains context and responds appropriately to new inputs. This feature is particularly valuable in multi-step agent workflows where context from previous steps influences future decisions, creating a more coherent and continuous [...] Traditional DAG frameworks struggle with these types of applications because they fundamentally cannot represent the looping patterns needed for agent decision-making.

This creates more adaptable AI systems that can handle complex, non-linear business processes.\\n\\n#### 3. Fine-Grained Control\\n\\nThe framework provides developers with precise control over agent workflows and state, enabling the creation of highly customized AI solutions tailored to specific business needs.\\n\\n#### 4. Seamless LangChain Integration [...] LangGraph represents a significant advancement in the LangChain ecosystem, specifically designed for creating and managing complex agent workflows. Unlike traditional frameworks that struggle with maintaining state and handling cyclical processes, LangGraph introduces a graph-based approach that enables AI agents to revisit previous steps, adapt to changing conditions, and maintain context throughout extended interactions.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langgraph\"/>\\nAgent systems: LangGraph provides a framework for building agent-based systems, which can be used in applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles or video games.\\n\\nLLM applications: By using LangGraphâs capabilities, developers can build more sophisticated AI models that learn and improve over time. Norwegian Cruise Line uses LangGraph to compile, construct and refine guest-facing AI solutions. This capability allows for improved and personalized guest experiences. [...] LangGraph, created by LangChain, is an open source AI agent framework designed to build, deploy and manage complex generative AI agent workflows. It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable users to create, run and optimize large language models (LLMs) in a scalable and efficient manner. At its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an AI agent workflow.\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe Semantic Web, sometimes known as Web 3.0, is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable.\\nTo enable the encoding of semantics with the data, technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) are used. These technologies are used to formally represent metadata. For example, ontology can describe concepts, relationships between entities, and categories of things. These embedded semantics offer significant advantages such as reasoning over data and operating with heterogeneous data sources.\\nThese standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, fundamentally the RDF. According to the W3C, \"The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.\" The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content and information applications and systems.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data (or data web) that can be processed by machinesâthat is, one in which much of the meaning is machine-readable. While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in library and information science, industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept.\\nBerners-Lee originally expressed his vision of the Semantic Web in 1999 as follows:\\n\\nI have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web â the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web\", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The \"intelligent agents\" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.\\nThe 2001 Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: \"This simple ideaâ¦remains largely unrealized\".\\nIn 2013, more than four million Web domains (out of roughly 250 million total) contained Semantic Web markup.\\n\\n\\n== Example ==\\nIn the following example, the text \"Paul Schuster was born in Dresden\" on a website will be annotated, connecting a person with their place of birth. The following HTML fragment shows how a small graph is being described, in RDFa-syntax using a schema.org vocabulary and a Wikidata ID:\\n\\nThe example defines the following five triples (shown in Turtle syntax). Each triple represents one edge in the resulting graph: the first element of the triple (the subject) is the name of the node where the edge starts, the second element (the predicate) the type of the edge, and the last and third element (the object) either the name of the node where the edge ends or a literal value (e.g. a text, a number, etc.).\\n\\nThe triples result in the graph shown in the given figure.\\n\\nOne of the advantages of using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) is that they can be dereferenced using the HTTP protocol. According to the so-called Linked Open Data principles, such a dereferenced URI should result in a document that offers further data about the given URI. In this example, all URIs, both for edges and nodes (e.g. http://schema.org/Person, http://schema.org/birthPlace, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731) can be dereferenced and will result in further RDF graphs, describing the URI, e.g. that Dresden is a city in Germany, or that a person, in the sense of that URI, can be fictional.\\nThe second graph shows the previous example, but now enriched with a few of the triples from the documents that result from dereferencing https://schema.org/Person (green edge) and https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731 (blue edges).\\nAdditionally to the edg\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(software)\" page=\"\"/>\\nReact (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library that aims to make building user interfaces based on components more \"seamless\". It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.\\nReact can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js and Remix. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only re-renders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.\\n\\n\\n== Notable features ==\\n\\n\\n=== Declarative ===\\nReact adheres to the declarative programming paradigm. Developers design views for each state of an application, and React updates and renders components when data changes. This is in contrast with imperative programming.\\n\\n\\n=== Components ===\\nReact code is made of entities called components. These components are modular and can be reused. React applications typically consist of many layers of components. The components are rendered to a root element in the DOM using the React DOM library. When rendering a component, values are passed between components through props (short for \"properties\"). Values internal to a component are called its state.\\nThe two primary ways of declaring components in React are through function components and class components. Since React v16.8, using function components is the recommended way.\\n\\n\\n=== Function components ===\\nFunction components, announced at React Conf 2018, and available since React v16.8, are declared with a function that accepts a single \"props\" argument and returns JSX. Function components can use internal state with the useState Hook.\\n\\n\\n=== React Hooks ===\\nOn February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was released to the public, introducing React Hooks. Hooks are functions that let developers \"hook into\" React state and lifecycle features from function components. Notably, Hooks do not work inside classes â they let developers use more features of React without classes.\\nReact provides several built-in hooks such as useState, useContext, useReducer, useMemo and useEffect. Others are documented in the Hooks API Reference. useState and useEffect, which are the most commonly used, are for controlling state and side effects, respectively.\\n\\n\\n==== Rules of hooks ====\\nThere are two rules of hooks which describe the characteristic code patterns that hooks rely on:\\n\\n\"Only call hooks at the top level\" â do not call hooks from inside loops, conditions, or nested statements so that the hooks are called in the same order each render.\\n\"Only call hooks from React functions\" â do not call hooks from plain JavaScript functions so that stateful logic stays with the component.\\nAlthough these rules cannot be enforced at runtime, code analysis tools such as linters can be configured to detect many mistakes during development. The rules apply to both usage of Hooks and the implementation of custom Hooks, which may call other Hooks.\\n\\n\\n=== Server components ===\\nReact server components (RSC)  are function components that run exclusively on the server.  The concept was first introduced in the talk \"Data Fetching with Server Components\". Though a similar concept to Server Side Rendering, RSCs do not send corresponding JavaScript to the client as no hydration occurs.  As a result, they have no access to hooks. However, they may be asynchronous function, allowing them to directly perform asynchronous operations:\\n\\nCurrently, server components are most readily usable with Next.js. With Next.js, it\\'s possible to write components for both the server and the client (browser). When a server rendered component is received by the browser, React in the browser takes over and creates the virtual DOM and attach event handlers. This is called hydration.\\n\\n\\n=== Class\\n</Document>']\n",

The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and is centered around stacking artificial neurons into layers and \"training\" them to process data. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\\nSome common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, transformers, and neural radiance fields. These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.\\nEarly forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems, particularly the human brain. However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nMost modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.\\nFundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face.\\nImportantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which level on its own. Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.\\nThe word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are ab\\n</Document>']\n"

Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the mid-1990s. Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel\\'s Checkers Playing Program, led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the first AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969â1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988â2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition. Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning. Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant\\'s PAC learning, Quinlan\\'s ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.\\nNeural networks, a subsymbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and reemerged strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt\\'s perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams, and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989. However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: \"Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn\\'t work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.\" Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nA short history of symbolic AI to the present day follows below. Time periods and titles are drawn from Henry Kautz\\'s 2020 AAAI Robert S. Engelmore Memorial Lecture and the longer Wikipedia article on the History of AI, with dates and titles differing slightly for increased clarity.\\n\\n\\n=== The first AI summer: irrational e\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence\" page=\"\"/>\\nArtificial intelligence is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in applications throughout industry and academia. Within the field of Artificial Intelligence, there are multiple subfields. The subfield of Machine learning has been used for various scientific and commercial purposes including language translation, image recognition, decision-making, credit scoring, and e-commerce. In recent years, there have been massive advancements in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence, which uses generative models to produce text, images, videos or other forms of data. This article describes applications of AI in different sectors. \\n\\n\\n== Agriculture ==\\n\\nIn agriculture, AI has been proposed as a way for farmers to identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatments to increase yields, thereby improving efficiency. AI has been used to attempt to classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and optimize irrigation.\\n\\n\\n== Architecture and design ==\\nAI in architecture has created a way for architects to create things beyond human understanding. AI implementation of machine learning text-to-render technologies, like DALL-E and stable Diffusion, gives power to visualization complex.\\nAI allows designers to demonstrate their creativity and even invent new ideas while designing. In future, AI will not replace architects; instead, it will improve the speed of translating ideas sketching.\\n\\n\\n== Business ==\\n\\n\\n=== Content extraction ===\\nAn optical character reader is used in the extraction of data in business documents like invoices and receipts. It can also be used in business contract documents e.g. employment agreements to extract critical data like employment terms, delivery terms, termination clauses, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Computer science ==\\n\\n\\n=== Programming assistance ===\\n\\n\\n==== AI-powered code assisting tools ====\\nAI can be used for real-time code completion, chat, and automated test generation. These tools are typically integrated with editors and IDEs as plugins. They differ in functionality, quality, speed, and approach to privacy. Code suggestions could be incorrect, and should be carefully reviewed by software developers before accepted. GitHub Copilot is one example. It was developed by GitHub and OpenAI and is able to autocomplete code in multiple programming languages.\\n\\n\\n==== Neural network design ====\\nAI can be used to create other AIs. For example, around November 2017, Google\\'s AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and POCO F1. NASNet\\'s performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet.\\n\\n\\n==== Quantum computing ====\\n\\nMachine learning has been used for noise-cancelling in quantum technology, including quantum sensors. Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic, quantum memristive device for neuromorphic (quantum-)computers (NC)/artificial neural networks and NC-using quantum materials with some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications, and quantum machine learning is a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used for quantum simulators which may have the application of solving physics and chemistry problems as well as for quantum annealers for training of neural networks for AI applications. There may also be some usefulness in chemistry, e.g. for drug discovery, and in materials science, e.g. for materials optimization/discovery (with possible relevance to quantum materials manufacturing).\\n\\n\\n=== Historical contributions ===\\nAI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science.

In the world of LLMs, this process is referred to as reflection.\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_life\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe history of life on Earth traces the processes by which living and extinct organisms evolved, from the earliest emergence of life to the present day. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago (abbreviated as Ga, for gigaannum) and evidence suggests that life emerged prior to 3.7 Ga. The similarities among all known present-day species indicate that they have diverged through the process of evolution from a common ancestor.\\nThe earliest clear evidence of life comes from biogenic carbon signatures and stromatolite fossils discovered in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks from western Greenland. In 2015, possible \"remains of biotic life\" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. There is further evidence of possibly the oldest forms of life  in the form of fossilized microorganisms in hydrothermal vent precipitates from the Nuvvuagittuq Belt, that may have lived as early as 4.28 billion years ago, not long after the oceans formed 4.4 billion years ago, and after the Earth formed 4.54 billion years ago. These earliest fossils, however, may have originated from non-biological processes.\\nMicrobial mats of coexisting bacteria and archaea were the dominant form of life in the early Archean eon, and many of the major steps in early evolution are thought to have taken place in this environment. The evolution of photosynthesis by cyanobacteria, around 3.5 Ga, eventually led to a buildup of its waste product, oxygen, in the oceans. After free oxygen saturated all available reductant substances on the Earth\\'s surface, it built up in the atmosphere, leading to the Great Oxygenation Event around 2.4 Ga. The earliest evidence of eukaryotes (complex cells with organelles) dates from 1.85 Ga, likely due to symbiogenesis between anaerobic archaea and aerobic proteobacteria in co-adaptation against the new oxidative stress. While eukaryotes may have been present earlier, their diversification accelerated when aerobic cellular respiration by the endosymbiont mitochondria provided a more abundant source of biological energy. Around 1.6 Ga, some eukaryotes gained the ability to photosynthesize via endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria, and gave rise to various algae that eventually overtook cyanobacteria as the dominant primary producers.\\nAt around 1.7 Ga, multicellular organisms began to appear, with differentiated cells performing specialised functions. While early organisms reproduced asexually, the primary method of reproduction for the vast majority of macroscopic organisms, including almost all eukaryotes (which includes animals and plants), is sexual reproduction, the fusion of male and female reproductive cells (gametes) to create a zygote. The origin and evolution of sexual reproduction remain a puzzle for biologists, though it is thought to have evolved from a single-celled eukaryotic ancestor.\\nWhile microorganisms formed the earliest terrestrial ecosystems at least 2.7 Ga, the evolution of plants from freshwater green algae dates back to about 1 billion years ago. Microorganisms are thought to have paved the way for the inception of land plants in the Ordovician period. Land plants were so successful that they are thought to have contributed to the Late Devonian extinction event as early tree Archaeopteris drew down CO2 levels, leading to global cooling and lowered sea levels, while their roots increased rock weathering and nutrient run-offs which may have triggered algal bloom anoxic events.\\nBilateria, animals having a left and a right side that are mirror images of each other, appeared by 555 Ma (million years ago). Ediacara biota appeared during the Ediacaran period, while vertebrates, along with most other modern phyla originated about 525 Ma during the Cambrian explosion. During the Permian period, synapsids, including the ancestors of mammals, dominated the land.\\nThe PermianâTriassic extinction event killed most complex species of its time, 252 Ma.

The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable.\\nTo enable the encoding of semantics with the data, technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) are used. These technologies are used to formally represent metadata. For example, ontology can describe concepts, relationships between entities, and categories of things. These embedded semantics offer significant advantages such as reasoning over data and operating with heterogeneous data sources.\\nThese standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, fundamentally the RDF. According to the W3C, \"The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.\" The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content and information applications and systems.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data (or data web) that can be processed by machinesâthat is, one in which much of the meaning is machine-readable. While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in library and information science, industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept.\\nBerners-Lee originally expressed his vision of the Semantic Web in 1999 as follows:\\n\\nI have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web â the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web\", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The \"intelligent agents\" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.\\nThe 2001 Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: \"This simple ideaâ¦remains largely unrealized\".\\nIn 2013, more than four million Web domains (out of roughly 250 million total) contained Semantic Web markup.\\n\\n\\n== Example ==\\nIn the following example, the text \"Paul Schuster was born in Dresden\" on a website will be annotated, connecting a person with their place of birth. The following HTML fragment shows how a small graph is being described, in RDFa-syntax using a schema.org vocabulary and a Wikidata ID:\\n\\nThe example defines the following five triples (shown in Turtle syntax). Each triple represents one edge in the resulting graph: the first element of the triple (the subject) is the name of the node where the edge starts, the second element (the predicate) the type of the edge, and the last and third element (the object) either the name of the node where the edge ends or a literal value (e.g. a text, a number, etc.).\\n\\nThe triples result in the graph shown in the given figure.\\n\\nOne of the advantages of using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) is that they can be dereferenced using the HTTP protocol. According to the so-called Linked Open Data principles, such a dereferenced URI should result in a document that offers further data about the given URI. In this example, all URIs, both for edges and nodes (e.g. http://schema.org/Person, http://schema.org/birthPlace, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731) can be dereferenced and will result in further RDF graphs, describing the URI, e.g. that Dresden is a city in Germany, or that a person, in the sense of that URI, can be fictional.\\nThe second graph shows the previous example, but now enriched with a few of the triples from the documents that result from dereferencing https://schema.org/Person (green edge) and https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731 (blue edges).\\nAdditionally to the edg\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(software)\" page=\"\"/>\\nReact (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library that aims to make building user interfaces based on components more \"seamless\". It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.\\nReact can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js and Remix. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only re-renders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.\\n\\n\\n== Notable features ==\\n\\n\\n=== Declarative ===\\nReact adheres to the declarative programming paradigm. Developers design views for each state of an application, and React updates and renders components when data changes. This is in contrast with imperative programming.\\n\\n\\n=== Components ===\\nReact code is made of entities called components. These components are modular and can be reused. React applications typically consist of many layers of components. The components are rendered to a root element in the DOM using the React DOM library. When rendering a component, values are passed between components through props (short for \"properties\"). Values internal to a component are called its state.\\nThe two primary ways of declaring components in React are through function components and class components. Since React v16.8, using function components is the recommended way.\\n\\n\\n=== Function components ===\\nFunction components, announced at React Conf 2018, and available since React v16.8, are declared with a function that accepts a single \"props\" argument and returns JSX. Function components can use internal state with the useState Hook.\\n\\n\\n=== React Hooks ===\\nOn February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was released to the public, introducing React Hooks. Hooks are functions that let developers \"hook into\" React state and lifecycle features from function components. Notably, Hooks do not work inside classes â they let developers use more features of React without classes.\\nReact provides several built-in hooks such as useState, useContext, useReducer, useMemo and useEffect. Others are documented in the Hooks API Reference. useState and useEffect, which are the most commonly used, are for controlling state and side effects, respectively.\\n\\n\\n==== Rules of hooks ====\\nThere are two rules of hooks which describe the characteristic code patterns that hooks rely on:\\n\\n\"Only call hooks at the top level\" â do not call hooks from inside loops, conditions, or nested statements so that the hooks are called in the same order each render.\\n\"Only call hooks from React functions\" â do not call hooks from plain JavaScript functions so that stateful logic stays with the component.\\nAlthough these rules cannot be enforced at runtime, code analysis tools such as linters can be configured to detect many mistakes during development. The rules apply to both usage of Hooks and the implementation of custom Hooks, which may call other Hooks.\\n\\n\\n=== Server components ===\\nReact server components (RSC)  are function components that run exclusively on the server.  The concept was first introduced in the talk \"Data Fetching with Server Components\". Though a similar concept to Server Side Rendering, RSCs do not send corresponding JavaScript to the client as no hydration occurs.  As a result, they have no access to hooks. However, they may be asynchronous function, allowing them to directly perform asynchronous operations:\\n\\nCurrently, server components are most readily usable with Next.js. With Next.js, it\\'s possible to write components for both the server and the client (browser). When a server rendered component is received by the browser, React in the browser takes over and creates the virtual DOM and attach event handlers. This is called hydration.\\n\\n\\n=== Class\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://medium.com/@ken_lin/langgraph-a-framework-for-building-stateful-multi-agent-llm-applications-a51d5eb68d03\"/>\\nThe most significant advantage of LangGraph is its explicit support for cyclical workflows, which are essential for implementing agent-like behaviors.

The cyclical nature of conversation, where each exchange builds on previous context, aligns perfectly with LangGraphâs support for stateful, iterative workflows. These agents can engage in multi-turn conversations, use tools to gather information, and progressively refine their responses based on user feedback. [...] LangGraph represents a significant advancement in the toolkit available for developing sophisticated LLM applications, particularly those involving agent-like behaviors and multi-agent coordination. By extending LangChain with support for cyclical workflows and robust state management, it addresses key limitations of earlier approaches and enables new possibilities for AI systems that can reason, act, and interact in more complex ways.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/local-ai-agents-with-langgraph-and-ollama\"/>\\n1. Cycles and Branching: Unlike other frameworks that use simple directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), LangGraph supports loops and conditionals, essential for creating sophisticated agent behaviors.\\n2.

This means you can create loops and branches, enabling your agents to adapt their behavior based on the current state.\\n   Human-in-the-Loop: Integrating human oversight is a natural fit for the graph structure. You can easily create nodes that pause the workflow and await human input or approval. [...] You are building complex, multi-step workflows that require a high degree of reliability.\\n   Auditability and debugging are critical concerns.\\n   You need to implement intricate logic with loops, branches, and error handling.\\n   You are already invested in the LangChain ecosystem and want to leverage its extensive tooling.\\n\\nIn essence, LangGraph provides the low-level control necessary to architect sophisticated, reliable agentic systems from the ground up. [...] Choose LangGraph if you are an architect who wants to build from the ground up. If you need precise control over every step of your agentâs workflow, value explicit state management, and want the flexibility to create highly custom, cyclical, and auditable systems, LangGraph provides the powerful, low-level primitives to do so.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://surma.dev/things/langgraph/\"/>\\nWhat we are working towards here is an âagentâ.

The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable.\\nTo enable the encoding of semantics with the data, technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) are used. These technologies are used to formally represent metadata. For example, ontology can describe concepts, relationships between entities, and categories of things. These embedded semantics offer significant advantages such as reasoning over data and operating with heterogeneous data sources.\\nThese standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, fundamentally the RDF. According to the W3C, \"The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.\" The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content and information applications and systems.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data (or data web) that can be processed by machinesâthat is, one in which much of the meaning is machine-readable. While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in library and information science, industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept.\\nBerners-Lee originally expressed his vision of the Semantic Web in 1999 as follows:\\n\\nI have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web â the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web\", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The \"intelligent agents\" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.\\nThe 2001 Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: \"This simple ideaâ¦remains largely unrealized\".\\nIn 2013, more than four million Web domains (out of roughly 250 million total) contained Semantic Web markup.\\n\\n\\n== Example ==\\nIn the following example, the text \"Paul Schuster was born in Dresden\" on a website will be annotated, connecting a person with their place of birth. The following HTML fragment shows how a small graph is being described, in RDFa-syntax using a schema.org vocabulary and a Wikidata ID:\\n\\nThe example defines the following five triples (shown in Turtle syntax). Each triple represents one edge in the resulting graph: the first element of the triple (the subject) is the name of the node where the edge starts, the second element (the predicate) the type of the edge, and the last and third element (the object) either the name of the node where the edge ends or a literal value (e.g. a text, a number, etc.).\\n\\nThe triples result in the graph shown in the given figure.\\n\\nOne of the advantages of using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) is that they can be dereferenced using the HTTP protocol. According to the so-called Linked Open Data principles, such a dereferenced URI should result in a document that offers further data about the given URI. In this example, all URIs, both for edges and nodes (e.g. http://schema.org/Person, http://schema.org/birthPlace, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731) can be dereferenced and will result in further RDF graphs, describing the URI, e.g. that Dresden is a city in Germany, or that a person, in the sense of that URI, can be fictional.\\nThe second graph shows the previous example, but now enriched with a few of the triples from the documents that result from dereferencing https://schema.org/Person (green edge) and https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731 (blue edges).\\nAdditionally to the edg\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning\" page=\"\"/>\\nIn machine learning, deep learning focuses on utilizing multilayered neural networks to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and representation learning. The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and is centered around stacking artificial neurons into layers and \"training\" them to process data. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\\nSome common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, transformers, and neural radiance fields. These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.\\nEarly forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems, particularly the human brain. However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nMost modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.\\nFundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face.\\nImportantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which level on its own. Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.\\nThe word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are ab\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://medium.com/@ken_lin/langgraph-a-framework-for-building-stateful-multi-agent-llm-applications-a51d5eb68d03\"/>\\nFor example, in an agent workflow, one might define an âagentâ node that decides what action to take and a âtoolsâ node that executes those actions. A conditional edge from the agent node could either continue to the tools node or exit the workflow based on the agentâs decision, with a regular edge returning from the tools back to the agent to form a cycle. This cyclical structure enables the iterative decision-making characteristic of agent systems. [...] LangGraph excels in building sophisticated conversational agents that maintain context, make decisions, and adapt their behavior based on user interactions. The cyclical nature of conversation, where each exchange builds on previous context, aligns perfectly with LangGraphâs support for stateful, iterative workflows. These agents can engage in multi-turn conversations, use tools to gather information, and progressively refine their responses based on user feedback. [...] The most significant advantage of LangGraph is its explicit support for cyclical workflows, which are essential for implementing agent-like behaviors. As emphasized in the documentation: âCrucially, this is NOT a DAG frameworkâ¦ Cycles are important for agent-like behaviors, where you call an LLM in a loop, asking it what action to take next.â This capability enables the development of sophisticated agents that can iteratively refine their understanding and actions, leading to more capable AI\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://medium.com/@lifanov.a.v/optimizing-initial-calls-in-langgraph-workflows-ef529278cb06\"/>\\n# We use the response to create a FunctionMessage\\n\\n function_message = FunctionMessage(content=str(response), name=action.tool)\\n\\n # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list\\n\\n return {\"messages\": [function_message]}\\n\\n# graph\\n\\nworkflow = StateGraph(AgentState)\\n\\n# Define the two nodes we will cycle between\\n\\nworkflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model)\\n\\nworkflow.add_node(\"action\", call_tool)\\n\\n# Set the entrypoint as `agent`\\n\\n# This means that this node is the first one called [...] \"name\": \"tavily_search_results_json\",\\n\\n \"arguments\": json.dumps({\"query\": human_input}),\\n\\n }\\n\\n },\\n\\n )\\n\\n ]\\n\\n }\\n\\n# ...\\n\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\\n\\n# Define a new graph\\n\\nworkflow = StateGraph(AgentState)\\n\\n# Define the new entrypoint\\n\\nworkflow.add_node(\"first_agent\", first_model)\\n\\n# Define the two nodes we will cycle between\\n\\nworkflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model)\\n\\nworkflow.add_node(\"action\", call_tool)\\n\\n# Set the entrypoint as `agent` [...] workflow.set_entry_point(\"agent\")\\n\\n# We now add a conditional edge\\n\\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\\n\\n # First, we define the start node.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on linear workflows, LangGraph introduces cyclic computational capabilities, enabling the creation of complex, adaptive agent systems [1, 5]. This is particularly significant because it allows LLM agents to dynamically loop through processes and make decisions based on evolving conditions [1, 3, 5]. This capability is inspired by systems like Pregel and Apache Beam and uses an interface similar to NetworkX [5].\\n\\nThe core innovation of LangGraph lies in its graph-based architecture, which models and manages the intricate relationships between various components of an AI agent workflow [3, 5]. This approach facilitates enhanced decision-making through the analysis of past actions and feedback, a process often referred to as reflection in the context of LLMs [3]. This framework supports the development of AI agents capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks, maintaining state across interactions, and adapting to new information [4]. This is a significant departure from earlier AI paradigms, such as symbolic AI, which struggled with knowledge acquisition and handling uncertainty [5].\\n\\nLangGraph's modular design further enables rapid customization and extension of agent capabilities without requiring core system redesign [4]. This is particularly useful for enterprises looking to enhance their operational capabilities and scale their agent's functionality [2]. The framework is designed to streamline the creation of cyclical graphs, which is a key element in advanced agent runtimes [5].\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n[1] https://medium.com/pythoneers/building-ai-agent-systems-with-langgraph-9d85537a6326\\n[2] https://www.rapidinnovation.io/post/ai-agents-in-langgraph\\n[3] https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langgraph\\n[4] https://www.royalcyber.com/blogs/ai-ml/build-ai-agents-langgraph-langchain/\\n[5] https://medium.com/@lorevanoudenhove/how-to-build-ai-agents-with-langgraph-a-step-by-step-guide-5d84d9c7e832\", \"## LangGraph: Architecting Advanced AI Agents\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nLangGraph emerges as a powerful framework for constructing sophisticated AI agents, particularly excelling in handling complex, multi-step tasks and cyclical workflows [1, 2, 3]. Unlike traditional LangChain agents, which often struggle with intricate flows, LangGraph provides explicit support for branching, looping, and state management, enabling iterative decision-making and improved error handling [2, 4]. This architecture offers several advantages, including clear separation of reasoning stages, enhanced transparency, and flexible integration of tools and services [1].\\n\\nA key strength of LangGraph is its ability to manage state across multiple interactions, crucial for maintaining context in multi-step agent workflows [3]. This feature allows agents to refine their understanding and actions iteratively, leading to more capable AI [3]. The framework's graph-based approach simplifies the creation of complex workflows and facilitates coordination between multiple agents [4]. While LangGraph may require more effort than ready-made solutions like CrewAI, it offers greater flexibility and control, allowing developers to build custom agent architectures [2]. The framework also provides control over streaming outputs, offering flexibility beyond LLM token streams [5].\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n[1]  https://www.royalcyber.com/blogs/ai-ml/build-ai-agents-langgraph-langchain/\\n[2]  https://medium.com/@saeedhajebi/langgraph-is-not-a-true-agentic-framework-3f010c780857\\n[3]  https://medium.com/@ken_lin/langgraph-a-framework-for-building-stateful-multi-agent-llm-applications-a51d5eb68d03\\n[4]  https://medium.com/@pankaj_pandey/building-advanced-ai-agents-with-langgraph-enhancing-your-llm-applications-c43c6803a9d2\\n[5]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCDrAbH_go&pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD\", \"## LangGraph: Building Advanced AI Agents\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nLangGraph distinguishes itself by enabling the creation of sophisticated AI agents through its support for cyclical workflows and state management [1].
